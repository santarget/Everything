**说明：**
计划做一个大而全的app，将目前常见的功能诸如新闻资讯、社交、网络音乐播放器、视频直播等都涵盖进来。
    当然随着功能集成越多，项目会越来越大，性能效率可能受影响，不过作为一个练手项目，这些都暂时忽略了。
    工程会按照功能模块进行分包，方便后期单独摘出某一功能。ui设计上尽量参照谷歌MD风格。发现一些好玩的新框架
    会随时加进来，开心就好。\

**Introduction：**
I plan to develop an App,which includes most functions we are using recently,
    like news and information display,communication,cloud music player,live streaming and so on.
    This project surely will be larger and larger,with more and more functions  being included,
    and so degrade performance.But it doesn't matter as a practical project.
    The project codes will be devided by functions,in order to pick single function expediently.
    UI refer to Material Design as possible.Interesting frame will be used at any time.
    Just enjoy it! \
